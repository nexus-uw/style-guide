  <h3 class="add-top">Usage</h3>
  <p>When clicking the Google Drive Picker button, you may need to authenticate yourself to use Google Picker by entering your Google credentials. Once authorized, the Google Picker modal is launched and you are prompted to select a file of your choice. By default, all Google Drive document types are displayed. You can specify a particular document type by providing a <code>view-id</code> attribute to the directive and the appropriate view type as the value. Refer to the Google Picker <a href="https://developers.google.com/picker/docs/reference#ViewId" target="_blank">documentation</a> for a complete list of View Ids.</p>
